    "Is there a positive correlation between the quality of life of different states in the United States, measured by multiple factors such as AQI, min wage, unemployment among many other factors, and the use of electric cars in that region. Aim to check if electric vehicles are more likely to exist in regions where quality of life is higher or if that is not the case."

    "Electrical vehicle (EV) sales have increased in the United States from 0.2% to 4.6% from 2011 to 2021 <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Sales and number of electric vehicles on the road are projected to increase over the next few years as well. According to S&P Global Mobility, 40% of passenger vehicles are expected to be electric vehicles by 2030 <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). As current California residents, it is interesting to see this anticipated growth – as of September 2021, the state ranks first for Tesla sales <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",

    "The growing market can be attributed to environmental concerns, money-saving concerns, government incentives (tax credits, rebates, programs), and job creation from the production of EVs <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). However, raises the question of access – who can drive the sales for this market, and who can participate? \n",

    "As governments attempt to transition to cleaner energy usage and promote the consumption of greener, electric vehicles, certain groups of people are excluded from the movement despite needing the benefits. Studies have shown that low-income, underrepresented communities live in areas of more transport emissions and lower air quality, so an increase in EVs would greatly improve living conditions <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). However, does this translate to electric vehicle numbers and distribution in these communities, and what variables contribute to this? \n",

    "Considering that clean energy is a generally progressive policy and the fact that clean energy is known to be more expensive than its alternatives, we expect there to be a positive relationship between those with a high quality of life and adoption of electric vehicles, because those with an already high quality of life can afford to adopt an environmentally friendly option. However, considering there are many other relevant factors that affect quality of life, along with the fact that different states have different policies and views on clean energy and are implementing them at different rates, we hypothesize that the correlation may be fairly weak."

    "The data collected might inadvertently exclude certain populations, especially those in rural areas or regions with limited internet access, leading to an incomplete representation. There's also a risk of bias in data collection methods, as regions with poor air quality or lower income might have less data available on EV ownership. Also, The proposed data might have biases, especially if it's primarily sourced from online platforms or regions with higher internet penetration. This could exclude populations in areas with limited internet access or those who don't engage online. To ensure this, the data collected should be diverse enough, covering both rural and urban areas. To detect biases, we'll conduct preliminary analyses to identify any underrepresented regions or demographics. During analysis, we'll use statistical methods to account for potential biases and ensure our findings are generalizable. A potential concern beyond the biases is the analysis could provide certain stereotypes to certain attributes like race and gender. To handle this, we need to have inclusive analysis on the data that we collected. "
