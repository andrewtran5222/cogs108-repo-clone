    "Considering that clean energy is a generally progressive policy and the fact that clean energy is known to be more expensive than its alternatives, we expect there to be a positive relationship between those with a high quality of life and adoption of electric vehicles, because those with an already high quality of life can afford to adopt an environmentally friendly option. However, considering there are many other relevant factors that affect quality of life, along with the fact that different states have different policies and views on clean energy and are implementing them at different rates, we hypothesize that the correlation may be fairly weak."

This dataset is a combination of various other datasets to create a comprehensive comparison table of metrics. Some columns of data are from different years, including 2016 Reported Crimes Rates versus 2022 Unemployment Rates. We plan to take into consideration the city type, unemployment, cost of living, median income, and air quality (good days/total) columns to determine quality of living per region. \n",

The data is sourced from the US Environmental Protection Agency and offers various information regarding the air quality indexes by state and county. We plan to find the percentage of ‘AQI%Good’ days by taking the proportion of recorded ‘Good Air’ days with the total number of recorded days. After filtering the data range to measure from 2000-2021, we will use it as an estimation of the air quality at a location and compare with the rest of our data. \n",

It also contains the percentage of vehicles in each jurisdiction per each vehicle category from before 1980 to 2018.

    "The data collected might inadvertently exclude certain populations, especially those in rural areas or regions with limited internet access, leading to an incomplete representation. There's also a risk of bias in data collection methods, as regions with poor air quality or lower income might have less data available on EV ownership. Also, The proposed data might have biases, especially if it's primarily sourced from online platforms or regions with higher internet penetration. This could exclude populations in areas with limited internet access or those who don't engage online. To ensure this, the data collected should be diverse enough, covering both rural and urban areas. \n",

    "To detect biases, we'll conduct preliminary analyses to identify any underrepresented regions or demographics. During analysis, we'll use statistical methods to account for potential biases and ensure our findings are generalizable. A potential concern beyond the biases is the analysis could provide certain stereotypes to certain attributes like race and gender. To handle this, we need to have inclusive analysis on the data that we collected. \n",

Using density plots and histogram will help us to observe data skew caused by over- or under-represented regions. The visualization displays the overall flow of the data, so it will be better for us to see the regions that are off from our expectation."
